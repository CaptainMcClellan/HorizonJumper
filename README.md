# HorizonJumper
A fork of the defunct ForeverFalling, to make it Spigot Compatible and add features.
Thusfar it has been built against Spigot 1.9.2 and is compatible with it. The jar will be released as soon as the basic functionality is established and the source code commited to this repo. You can also find the jar and information at http://somethinghub.com/magicant/programs/HorizonJumper

You are free to fork, build and distribute this plugin compliant to the BSD license including here, though with the additional request that you name your project something different or clear it with me. However, it'd be much more appreciated if you contributed here and just put in a pull request instead.
